# Assumptions

1. All users are valid, no need to create a signin module or handle sessions.
2. Think of a solution that can scale to millions of users (e.g., 100M users).
3. The application must be optimized for reads.

## Additional assumptions

### Functionalities

- No processing of mentions inside tweets.
- No processing of hashtags inside tweets.
- Users can't interact with tweets (like, retweet, reply).
- Users can't follow themselves.
