# Microblogging API Documentation

Welcome to the Microblogging API documentation. This documentation provides detailed information about the API endpoints, request/response formats, and examples.

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to create a simplified version of a microblogging platform similar to Twitter that allows users to post tweets, follow users and view their own timelines.

1. Tweets: Users can post tweets that do not exceed a character limit (e.g., 280 characters).
2. Follow: Users can follow other users.
3. Timeline: Users can view their own timelines.

## Getting Started
